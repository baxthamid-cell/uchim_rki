By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

b. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, but not limited to, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 2 – Scope

a. License grant.

1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent effective technological measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) does not create Adapted Material.

B. Offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material. Every recipient of Adapted Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

C. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any effective technological measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are connected with, sponsored or endorsed by, or have official status with, the Licensor, or that the Licensor endorses You or Your use of the Licensed Material, or that You received monetary compensation for the exercise of the Licensed Rights.

b. Other rights.

1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any moral rights held by the licensor to the extent necessary to exercise the licensed rights, but not otherwise.

2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

3. To the extent possible, the licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid your exercise of the licensed rights, including without limitation the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the absence of a license, through a collecting society organization.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights

1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
